# Session Handoff - QuickWin Project

## Date: 2025-08-02 (Session 4)

### Major Accomplishments This Session

1. **Backend File Processing Implementation**
   - Created CSV processing endpoint that extracts columns and data
   - Implemented job processing orchestration
   - Added Excel export functionality with xlsx package
   - Connected frontend to backend processing flow

2. **Schema Source Tracking**
   - Added `source` column to track how schemas were created
   - Added `last_used_at` automatic timestamp updates
   - Fixed "Use Recent Schema" to only show manually created schemas

3. **Job Creation Flow**
   - Jobs are now created when users reach the mapping step
   - File records are properly stored in database
   - Column mappings are persisted before processing

4. **Build Fixes**
   - Fixed server-side `createClient()` calls (no parameters needed)
   - Fixed TypeScript type annotations

### Current State
- CSV file processing is fully functional end-to-end
- Users can upload CSV files, map columns, and download merged Excel files
- Basic fuzzy matching for column mapping suggestions
- Job status tracking throughout the process

### Next Priority Tasks

1. **Testing**
   - Test the complete flow with real CSV files
   - Verify Excel downloads work correctly
   - Check error handling for edge cases

2. **Excel Import**
   - Implement `/api/process/excel` endpoint
   - Use openpyxl or similar to parse Excel files
   - Extract headers from first row

3. **Enhanced AI Mapping**
   - Integrate OpenAI for smarter column suggestions
   - Improve confidence scoring algorithm
   - Add learning from user corrections

4. **Recent Jobs History**
   - Create jobs list page
   - Show processing status and download links
   - Allow re-running jobs with same mappings

### Technical Notes
- Python serverless functions are set up but not used (went with Node.js approach)
- CSV parsing happens both client-side (for immediate feedback) and server-side
- Consider implementing WebSocket or polling for real-time progress updates

### Critical File Locations
- Backend routes: `/app/api/`
- Processing logic: `/app/api/process/csv/route.ts`
- Job orchestration: `/app/api/jobs/[id]/process/route.ts`
- Download endpoint: `/app/api/jobs/[id]/download/route.ts`
- Updated components: `MappingStep.tsx`, `ProcessingStep.tsx`
