# Session Handoff - QuickWin Project

## Date: 2025-08-02 (Session 5)

### Session Summary
This session focused on implementing and debugging the backend file processing functionality for CSV files. The user tested the feature and encountered issues with column detection and processing errors.

### Major Issues Fixed

1. **TypeScript Build Errors**
   - Fixed server-side `createClient()` calls (doesn't take parameters)
   - Added type annotations for all map, filter, and forEach callbacks
   - Fixed variable scope issues in error handlers

2. **Column Detection Issues**
   - Added debug logging to MappingStep component
   - Fixed file path extraction for Supabase Storage downloads
   - Path format: `${jobId}/${fileName}`

3. **Processing Endpoint Errors**
   - Removed problematic internal fetch calls
   - Implemented direct CSV processing in job endpoint
   - Fixed "Unexpected end of JSON input" error

### Current Implementation Status

#### Working Features:
- User authentication and profile management
- Schema creation with source tracking
- File upload to Supabase Storage
- Job creation when reaching mapping step
- CSV column detection (client-side)
- Column mapping persistence
- Basic fuzzy matching for suggestions
- Excel export with xlsx package

#### Backend Processing Flow:
1. Job created in mapping step with status 'pending'
2. Files stored in `job-files` bucket as `{jobId}/{fileName}`
3. CSV processed to extract columns and sample data
4. Mappings saved to `column_mappings` table
5. Job status updated: pending → processing → completed/failed
6. Excel file generated for download

### Test Files Used
User provided two CSV test files:
- `QuickWin Test - Sheet1.csv`: First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Credit Card Number, Balance
- `QuickWin Test - Altered - Sheet1.csv`: Name, Email, Phone Number, Credit Card, Charge Amount

### Known Issues to Address

1. **Mapping UI Not Showing**
   - The review mappings page showed empty (no tables)
   - Debug logs added to help troubleshoot
   - Likely file download path issue

2. **Limited File Support**
   - Only CSV processing implemented
   - Excel, PDF, and image processing still TODO

### Next Priority Tasks

1. **Debug Column Detection**
   - Check browser console logs
   - Verify file download paths
   - Ensure CSV parsing works correctly

2. **Complete Testing**
   - Test with various CSV formats
   - Verify Excel download functionality
   - Check edge cases (empty files, special characters)

3. **Implement Excel Processing**
   - Add `/api/process/excel` endpoint
   - Use xlsx package to read Excel files
   - Extract headers and data

4. **Add Real-time Progress**
   - Consider WebSocket or polling
   - Show actual processing status
   - Better error messages

### Technical Notes

- CSV parsing uses simple comma splitting (needs improvement for quoted values)
- Processing happens synchronously (could be moved to background job)
- File size limits not implemented
- No validation for malicious files

### Critical Code Locations

- **API Routes:**
  - `/app/api/jobs/[id]/process/route.ts` - Main processing orchestrator
  - `/app/api/process/csv/route.ts` - CSV processing (not used currently)
  - `/app/api/jobs/[id]/download/route.ts` - Excel download

- **Components:**
  - `/components/jobs/MappingStep.tsx` - Column detection and mapping UI
  - `/components/jobs/ProcessingStep.tsx` - Processing status display

- **Key Functions:**
  - `processCSVFile()` - Inline CSV processing
  - `loadData()` in MappingStep - Job creation and column detection

### Environment Details
- Supabase Storage bucket: 'job-files'
- File path format: `{jobId}/{fileName}`
- Database tracking: jobs, job_files, column_mappings
- Schema source tracking: 'manual', 'template', 'import'

### Session Metrics
- Commits: 7
- Files modified: ~15
- Main focus: Backend processing implementation
- Build attempts: 5 (multiple TypeScript fixes needed)
