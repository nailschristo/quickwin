# Session Handoff

## Session Date: 2025-08-02

### Current Status
- QuickWin application fully scaffolded with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- Complete authentication system implemented (awaiting Supabase configuration)
- Database schema and storage SQL scripts ready to run
- Application cannot run until Supabase is configured

### Completed in This Session
1. **Documentation Setup**
   - Created CLAUDE.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, SESSION_HANDOFF.md
   - Established consistent working methodology per CLAUDE.md requirements
   - Created comprehensive README.md with setup instructions

2. **Next.js Project Initialization**
   - Set up Next.js 14 with App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
   - Fixed CSS compilation errors (border-border class issue)
   - Created basic project structure with proper directories

3. **Supabase Integration (Code Complete)**
   - Created client/server/middleware utilities using @supabase/ssr
   - Defined complete database schema with 5 tables
   - Implemented Row Level Security policies for all tables
   - Created storage bucket configuration with RLS
   - Built helper functions for file operations

4. **Authentication System (Code Complete)**
   - Implemented AuthContext with useAuth hook
   - Created login page with email/password and OAuth options
   - Created signup page with password confirmation
   - Built OAuth callback handler
   - Protected dashboard route with auth check
   - Sign out functionality

5. **Database Design**
   - schemas table (user-defined data structures)
   - schema_columns table (fields within schemas)
   - jobs table (processing sessions)
   - job_files table (uploaded files)
   - column_mappings table (source to target mappings)

### Next Session Tasks
1. **Supabase Configuration (REQUIRED FIRST)**
   - User needs to create Supabase project
   - Run `/supabase/schema.sql` in SQL Editor
   - Run `/supabase/storage.sql` in SQL Editor  
   - Copy credentials to `.env.local`
   - Configure OAuth providers (optional)

2. **Once Supabase is configured:**
   - Test authentication flow
   - Create schema management API routes
   - Build schema creation UI
   - Implement column editor with drag-and-drop
   - Add sample schema templates

### Current Todo List Status
- ‚úÖ Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- ‚úÖ Set up Supabase for authentication and database
- ‚úÖ Configure file storage (Supabase Storage)
- ‚úÖ Implement user authentication (email/password + OAuth)
- ‚è≥ Create database schema for user-defined schemas (SQL ready, needs to be run)
- üìã Build UI for schema creation/editing
- üìã Implement schema preview functionality
- üìã Add ability to save/load/delete schemas

### Important Files Created
- `/supabase/schema.sql` - Complete database schema with RLS
- `/supabase/storage.sql` - Storage bucket configuration
- `/lib/supabase/*` - Supabase client utilities
- `/contexts/auth-context.tsx` - Authentication state management
- `/app/auth/*` - Authentication pages
- `/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Protected dashboard
- `/.env.local` - Environment variables template

### Key Technical Decisions
- Next.js 14 App Router for modern React features
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
- Supabase for complete backend (auth, db, storage)
- Row Level Security for data protection
- @supabase/ssr for server-side auth
- Client-side context for auth state

### Blockers/Issues
- Application cannot run without Supabase credentials
- User needs to set up Supabase project first
- OAuth providers optional but recommended

### Success Metrics for Next Session
1. Supabase project created and configured
2. Authentication flow working (signup/login/logout)
3. User can access protected dashboard
4. Schema creation UI started
5. At least one schema can be saved to database

### Commands for Next Session
```bash
# After Supabase is configured:
npm install  # If needed
npm run dev  # Start development server

# For deployment later:
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

### Notes for Next Session
- Start by verifying Supabase setup
- Test auth flow thoroughly before proceeding
- Focus on schema CRUD operations
- Consider UX for column type selection
- Plan for sample data preview feature
