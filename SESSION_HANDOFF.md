# Session Handoff - QuickWin Project

## Date: 2025-08-02 (Session 6)

### Session Summary
This session focused on fixing critical UI/UX issues with column mapping and implementing a transformation system for handling complex data mappings like name splitting.

### Major Accomplishments

1. **Fixed React Rendering Issue**
   - Column dropdowns were showing incorrect options for different files
   - Created separate component approach didn't work
   - Final fix: Modified select key to include column content
   - Root cause: React's reconciliation was reusing DOM elements

2. **Reversed Mapping UI Direction**
   - Changed from "Schema → Source" to "Source → Schema" 
   - More intuitive: users see their file columns and choose where to map them
   - Updated AI suggestions to work with new direction

3. **Implemented Transformation System Architecture**
   - Created database schema for transformations
   - Built transformation engine with support for:
     - Split (e.g., "John Doe" → First: "John", Last: "Doe")
     - Combine (e.g., Date + Time → DateTime)
     - Format (e.g., phone number cleaning)
     - Extract (e.g., email domain)
     - Conditional logic
   - Added smart name splitting that handles multiple formats

4. **Integrated Name Splitting**
   - Automatically detects when "Name" is mapped to "First Name"
   - Splits and populates both First and Last Name columns
   - Visual indicator in UI showing transformation will occur
   - Works in download/export functionality

### Current Implementation Status

#### Working Features:
- File upload to Supabase Storage (job-files bucket)
- CSV column detection with correct columns per file
- Intuitive source → target mapping interface
- Basic name splitting transformation
- AI-suggested mappings with fuzzy matching
- Job creation and status tracking
- Excel export with transformations applied

#### Known Issues:
1. **JSON Parsing Error** during job processing (ProcessingStep)
2. **Limited Transformation Support** - only name splitting implemented
3. **No UI for Custom Transformations** - hardcoded for name fields

### Files Modified
- `/components/jobs/MappingStep.tsx` - Reversed UI, fixed rendering
- `/app/api/jobs/[id]/download/route.ts` - Added name splitting
- `/supabase/migrations/20250802000009_add_column_transformations.sql` - New schema
- `/types/transformations.ts` - Transformation type definitions
- `/lib/transformations/engine.ts` - Transformation processing engine
- `/lib/transformations/common.ts` - Common transformation patterns

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Transformation Database Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE column_transformations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    job_id UUID REFERENCES jobs(id),
    transformation_type VARCHAR(50),
    source_columns TEXT[],
    target_columns TEXT[],
    configuration JSONB,
    execution_order INTEGER
);
```

#### Smart Name Splitting Logic:
- Handles "Last, First" format
- Splits on space for "First Last" format
- Handles middle names by grouping with last name
- Provides empty string defaults

### Next Priority Tasks

1. **Fix JSON Parsing Error**
   - Debug ProcessingStep component
   - Ensure proper response handling
   - Add better error messages

2. **Complete Transformation UI**
   - Add transformation configuration modal
   - Allow users to customize split behavior
   - Preview transformation results

3. **Implement Additional Transformations**
   - Date/time combinations
   - Phone number formatting
   - Address splitting
   - Custom regex patterns

4. **Test End-to-End Flow**
   - Upload → Map → Transform → Process → Download
   - Verify all data integrity
   - Handle edge cases

### Environment & Configuration
- Supabase Storage bucket: `job-files`
- Transformation types: split, combine, format, extract, conditional
- Name splitting: Automatic for "Name" → "First Name" mappings

### Session Metrics
- Commits: 8
- Major bugs fixed: 2 (React rendering, UI direction)
- New features: 1 (Transformation system)
- Files created: 5 (transformation system)
- Build attempts: 3 (all successful)

### Critical Notes for Next Session
1. The transformation engine is built but only name splitting is integrated
2. The UI shows transformation will happen but doesn't allow customization
3. The JSON parsing error in processing needs immediate attention
4. Consider adding transformation templates for common patterns
