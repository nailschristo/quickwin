# Session Handoff - QuickWin Project

## Date: 2025-08-02 (Session 3)

### What Was Being Done
Improving the New Job page UX based on user feedback:
- Schema selection step needed better user experience
- "Use Recent Schema" shouldn't show if no schemas exist
- Button text should be dynamic based on selection
- Template schemas shouldn't appear in recent schemas list

### Changes Made This Session

1. **Database Migration Created**
   - File: `/supabase/migrations/20250802000004_schema_source_tracking.sql`
   - Added `source` column to track schema creation method ('manual', 'template', 'import')
   - Added `last_used_at` column to track schema usage
   - Created trigger to update `last_used_at` when jobs are created

2. **SchemaStep Component Updates**
   - File: `/components/jobs/SchemaStep.tsx`
   - ✅ Conditional display of "Use Recent Schema" (only shows if schemas exist)
   - ✅ Filter schemas to show only manually created ones
   - ✅ Sort by last_used_at with recently used indicator (⭐)
   - ✅ Dynamic button text based on selection
   - ✅ Added helpful descriptions for each option
   - ✅ Implemented file upload for Excel import option
   - ✅ Auto-select template option when no schemas exist

### Next Steps Required

1. **Push Database Migration**
   ```bash
   npx supabase db push --password "I#9winesdaily"
   ```

2. **Update Schema Creation Pages**
   - Update `/app/schemas/new/page.tsx` to set `source: 'manual'` when creating schemas
   - Handle Excel import functionality (parse headers, create schema)

3. **Test & Deploy**
   - Commit changes
   - Push to GitHub
   - Verify on Vercel deployment

### Current Todo Status
- Improve New Job page UX: IN PROGRESS (90% complete)
- Add schema source tracking to database: PENDING (migration created, needs push)
- Implement Excel import functionality: PENDING

### Key Files Modified
- `/components/jobs/SchemaStep.tsx` - Main improvements
- `/supabase/migrations/20250802000004_schema_source_tracking.sql` - New migration

The UX improvements are nearly complete, just need to push the migration and handle the schema creation source tracking.
